# weather-conditions-analysis

I applied what I've learned about Python APIs to answer questions on countries, cities and weather, by creating a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator to know what is the weather like as we approach the equator. The analysis is broken into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy

# Data used

output_data/cities.csv

# VacationPy

Using the information provided in the output_data/cities.csv file, I created a city map that shows a point on the map for each city listed in the city_data_df DataFrame.
